### Base R

First let's look at dates and times in base R. First days. Note that you can do arithmetic on dates.

```{r}
hire_date <- as.Date("2016-09-01")
days_employed <- Sys.Date() - hire_date
print(days_employed)
```
Now let's look at time. You can do arithmetic on time as well. 

```{r}
birth_date <- as.Date("1989-04-18")
difftime(Sys.Date(), birth_date, units="secs")
```
### Lubridate

The lubridate package was created to simplify date and time processing.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
today()
now()
```

The airquality data has month and year columns. The documentation states that the year is 1973. We will put these together to create a date field. 

```{r}
df <- airquality[]
df$date <- ymd(paste("1973",airquality$Month,airquality$Day))
print(range(df$date))
df$date[nrow(df)] - df$date[1]  # time difference
```
