# 4375 Schedule of Topics


We will discuss Chapters in a slightly different order than presented in the book.

## Part 1 : Intro to R and Machine Learning

The goal in this part of the course is to get a general feel for machine learning, to learn R, to get experience with a regression paradigm, a classification paradigm, and an unsupervised clustering paradigm. You will learn enough about R and machine learning to complete project 1. This material will be on Exam 1.

Chapters:

* 1 Intro
* 2 Learning R
* 3: Linear Regression
* 4: Logistic Regression
* 7: Data Wrangling
* 8: kNN
* 9: Clustering

## Part 2: More Algorithms!

The goal in this part of the course is to expand your skill set with more algorithms. You will learn enough algorithms to complete project 2. This material, as well as some material from Part 1, will be on Exam 2.

Chapters:

* 5: Naive Bayes
* 6: Support Vector Machines
* 10: Decision Trees
* 11: Feature Selection
* 12: Neural Networks
* 13: Deep Learning
* 14: Practical Advice

## Part 3: Modeling the World

The goal in this part of the course is to describe other approaches to statistical and probabilistic learning that seek to model the world. This material will be covered on the cumulative Final Exam.

Chapters:

* 15: Bayes Nets
* 16: Markov Models
* 17: Reinforecement Learning
* 18: The 5 Tribes of Machine Learning

## Extra Material

Along the way we will briefly discuss other material as well as the material in the Appenices. These discussions are for informational purposes and will not be tested over.
